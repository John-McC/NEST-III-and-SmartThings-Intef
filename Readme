I am starting today, Nov 27. I intend to create an object that contains NEST3 data that I can pull into SmartTHings. I will
use the NEST data and my SmartThings IOT data to make decisions about how to more efficiently heat or cool my house
I'm retired and want a place to play with my smartthings. I'm not bored, just want a techincal challenge after 37 years
